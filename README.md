# nonlinear-models

This repository contains the materials for a self study course on nonlinear models. I'm currently taking this course at SDSU with Dr. Barbara Bailey who so kindly accepted my proposal that she supervise my efforts.

Since this is a self study course, there isn't a detailed plan in terms of topics to be covered or level of depth for each topic. My current plan is to study:

- Splines of various sorts
- Generalized additive models
- Nonlinear models for time series

More topics may be added as the semester progresses. For the most part I will demonstrate what I learn through [my blog](https://asbates.rbind.io).
